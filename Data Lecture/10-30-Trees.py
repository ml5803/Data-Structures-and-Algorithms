'''
    Family Relationships:
        child of a node
        parent of a node
        siblings of a node - node with same parent
        u is an ancestor of v - if there is a path from u to v
        u is a descendant of v - if there is a path from v to u
        
    Terminology:
        edge(u,v): u is the parent of v
        path in the tree: sequence of nodes where each two subsequent node are connected by an edge
        length of a path: number of edges in the path
        depth(level of a node) - starts at level 0
        height of a tree - length of longest path
        
    Types of nodes:
        root
        leaf
        internal node
        *subtree rooted by a node
        
    Kinds of trees:
        binary tree - each node has at most 2 children
        full (proper) binary tree - each node has 2 or 0 children
        complete binary tree - all levels have the maximum number of nodes
